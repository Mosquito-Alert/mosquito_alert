<p> Mosquito Alert is a citizen science system that allows collaboration among various actors in the study, monitoring
    and control of mosquitoes that are vectors of diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya or West Nile fever. The
    Mosquito Alert app (formerly Tigatrapp) is an application for mobile phones and tablets that allows anyone to
    participate in Mosquito Alert. </p> <p> The Mosquito Alert app has been developed by the following institutions: the
    Spanish National Research Council’s Blanes Center for Advanced Studies (CEAB-CSIC), the Center for Ecological
    Research and Forest Applications (CREAF), Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) and the Catalan Institute for Research and
    Advanced Studies (ICREA). </p> <p> The source code for the Mosquito Alert app is available on the project website at
    <a href="http://www.mosquitoalert.com/en/">www.mosquitoalert.com</a>. </p> <p> Authors (in alphabetical order):
