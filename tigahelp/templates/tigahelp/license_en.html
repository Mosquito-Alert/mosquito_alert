<p>Mosquito Alert (formerly Tigatrapp) is an application that harnesses the power of citizen scientists and new technologies to
investigate the spread of tiger mosquitoes and yellow fever mosquitoes.
The application was developed by the 
 <a href="http://movelab.net">ICREA Movement Ecology Laboratory</a>at the Center for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC).
  The code is drawn in part from <a href="http://activityspaceproject.com">Space Mapper</a> (John R.B. Palmer), and the <a href="http://pmp.princeton.edu/">Human Mobility Project</a> 
 (Chang Y. Chung, Kathleen Li and Necati E. Ozgencil). 
 The Tigatrapp code is freely available from the Movement Ecology Lab.</p>
