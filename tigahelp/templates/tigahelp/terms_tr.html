<p> Mosquito Alert (in any of the names it may have had in the past or may acquire in the future) is a citizen science
    system run by the Spanish National Research Council's Blanes Center for Advanced Studies (CEAB-CSIC), the Center for
    Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF), Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) and the Catalan Institute for
    Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). </p> <p> Mosquito Alert depends on the public's collection of data on various
    disease-vector mosquito species. Citizens participate by sending and sharing, data and images, through the various
    Mosquito Alert applications for mobile and other electronic devices. Participants must be adults or must participate
    under the supervision of an adult, in accordance with the legislation of Spain and of their country of residence.
    Participants must also accept Mosquito Alert’s privacy policy, and agree to the following terms of use: </p>
<ol>
    <li> The mosquito species that Mosquito Alert works with can be vectors of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and
        Zika. Mosquito Alert contributes to fighting these diseases, by collecting data and images, analysing this
        information, and carrying out public awareness, monitoring and mosquito control activities. As these mosquitoes
        are disease vectors, when participating in Mosquito Alert you must exercise extreme caution and you must not
        seek out these species (directly or through their breeding places), especially in places where the diseases they
        transmit are endemic, or during an outbreak of such diseases. Participating in Mosquito Alert can involve
        reporting the encounters you have with mosquitoes during your normal activities, and changing your activities to
        reduce your exposure to mosquitoes and their breeding sites. You accept that you should not in any way increase
        your exposure to mosquitoes by participating in this project.
    </li>
    <li> By sharing your data and works (e.g. photographs) with Mosquito Alert, you agree to these terms of use, you
        accept that the works (e.g. photographs) be disseminated anonymously without stating your name or pseudonym and
        you grant the institutions that run Mosquito Alert a license for your work of duration equal to the applicable
        copyright in force to be able to exploit the work without any restriction and assign it to third parties
        worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and sub-licensable. In any case, these terms do not imply for the
        original author any restriction on the use of his or her works, being able to exploit it by other means in a
        manner compatible with the assignment granted by this document.
    </li>
    <li> As a general rule, any original creation that can be protected by copyright will be disseminated by Mosquito
        Alert with a CC BY license, indicating anonymous author and the name of the project (example: Anonymous, CC BY
        Mosquito Alert), even if it contains the author's name in it or in its metadata. When possible, part of the
        databases or tables resulting from user contributions will be released, as a general rule, under a CC0 license.
        In the event of the need to give access to sensitive information to third parties (e.g. professionals in charge
        of mosquitoes monitoring and control, research personnel, public health managers, etc.), appropriate protocols
        and/or licenses will be established for this dissemination.
    </li>
    <li> You guarantee that you have the necessary legal rights over the data and works that you share with Mosquito
        Alert and that these are not defamatory, and do not violate any law. Participation in Mosquito Alert is
        anonymous to guarantee the protection of the participants’ privacy. Therefore, you guarantee that you will not
        add personal information of yourself or of third parties in the data or works that you send to Mosquito Alert.
        You understand that these data or works may be transferred to third parties, and that Mosquito Alert cannot
        guarantee the ability to eliminate any possible personal data that you send by mistake.
    </li>
    <li> You agree to indemnify individuals, institutions and/or members of Mosquito Alert and collaborators for any
        legal and/or monetary burden and any other expense that may be incurred as a result of your breach of the above
        guarantee.
    </li>
