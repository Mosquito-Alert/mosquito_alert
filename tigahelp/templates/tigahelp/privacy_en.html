<p>Mosquito Alert (in any of the names that it may have had in the past or may acquire in the future) collects, among
    other things, data and images shared by volunteers and makes them available to third parties and the general public.
    In order to protect the privacy of its volunteers, Mosquito Alert aims to avoid collecting personal information,
    meaning information that can be used to individually identify a specific natural person. Thus, Mosquito Alert
    requests that volunteers not transmit names, addresses, passwords and any other personal information when sending
    reports. The exact locations of observations are collected during report submission, and these may coincide with the
    exact location of volunteers, but this information is linked only to the report and to a randomly generated user ID.
    Photograph metadata is not requested, and if photographs sent to the project through the app contain metadata, this
    metadata will be deleted once the image reaches the project server, with the exception of the photograph
    geolocation, which will be kept associated with the photograph and may be published.</p> <p>Mosquito Alert also
    collects the approximate location of the volunteers at random intervals in time (in order to assess the geographic
    areas covered or explored by the volunteers), but this information is also only linked to a randomly generated user
    identifier. Volunteers may include notes and photographs in their reports, but it is their responsibility not to
    include in these notes and photographs any information they wish to keep private or any information that violates
    the privacy rights of others or is inconsistent with the Mosquito Alert user agreement.</p> <p>Mosquito Alert has
    mechanisms to prevent, as far as possible, personal data that users may have sent by mistake, despite anonymization
    measures, from being shared with the general public. Likewise, Mosquito Alert applies measures to detect if personal
    data has been shared and to eliminate it from the database, as far as possible. Despite this, if in any particular
    case these measures do not prevent the publication of a personal data, those who detect it are encouraged to notify
    those responsible for Mosquito Alert, in order to proceed to eliminate its appearance in public space if possible.
    Mosquito Alert cannot guarantee the elimination of personal data that could be collected by Mosquito Alert by
    mistake despite the anonymization measures, nor can it guarantee that such data will be not visible to members of
    Mosquito Alert or to any of its collaborators or third parties.</p> <p>It is noted that if participants share their
    observations (reports) in any public medium, such as on social networks, they may be associating these observations
    with their personal data (e.g. personal account on social networks), thus giving up, voluntarily, the anonymity that
    the project seeks to provide.</p> <p>Mosquito Alert allows participants to keep their data while maintaining
    anonymity, through an authentication system using external accounts (email, Facebook, Twitter), through Firebase.
    This allows participants to sync multiple devices and recover data if they have to uninstall the app. This option is
    voluntary and is not activated by default. In any case, the information collected by Firebase for this purpose is
    not stored on the Mosquito Alert servers, is not linked to the scientific data collected by Mosquito Alert, and is
    not processed by Mosquito Alert.</p> <p>A detailed list of the information that Mosquito Alert collects is as
    follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reports collected and sent by volunteers in relation to breeding sites, bites and sightings of possible
        mosquitoes (Mosquito Alert currently focuses on 5 different species of mosquitoes), as well as volunteers
        responses to questions sent to them through the app. This includes the precise location of the volunteer
        observations and photographs (as well as photograph metadata location, if any), notes, or any other information
        that the volunteer adds to the report.
    </li>
    <li>Information on the approximate location of the volunteers, sampled in background mode and at random time
        intervals. This information is collected for scientific purposes, to know the geographical areas explored by the
        volunteers (sampling effort, that is, in which areas there is or is not participation and to what extent, to be
        able to relate it to the number of observations in that same area by example with modeling techniques or
        statistics), and to improve knowledge about mosquito dispersal pathways related to human mobility (that is, to
        better understand the relationship between how people move on a large scale and the dispersal of these species
        in the territory). This information is of great scientific interest. To avoid collection of the exact locations
        of volunteers, these locations are placed on a grid of 0.025 degrees latitude and longitude and only the
        identifier of the grid squares they fall into is transmitted to the server. Thus, it is impossible to determine
        the actual location, within an area of ​​0.025 degrees latitude by 0.025 degrees longitude (between about 3.1
        and about 7.7 square km, or between 765 and 1901 football fields). In any case, volunteers can deactivate this
        option, activated by default, in the application settings.
    </li>
    <li>Information about the phone model, battery, language settings, and the app version (that is, the version
        installed and the operating system and version in which it is installed). This information is used to help the
        research team improve the application.
    </li>
    <li>If the volunteer chooses to authenticate through an external account using Firebase, then Firebase may collect
        the email address, password, phone number, IP address and other information associated with that external
        account.
    </li>
</ul>
