<h1><b>PARTICIPATE</b></h1>

<p>Participate in the study and monitoring of tiger mosquitoes in Spain by sending reports on breeding sites and adult
    tiger mosquito sightings. Get the latest news and learn to combat tiger mosquitoes in your home.</p>

<h2><b>Learn about the tiger mosquito</b></h2>
Learn to recognize the tiger mosquito and make sure not to confuse it with other mosquitoes. Learn about the mosquito's
life cycle and breeding places. The app and the project website (AtrapaelTigre.com) contain all the information
necessary for gathering quality data.

<h2>Begin sharing data </h2>
Use the "REPORT" buttons on the main screen to send reports on breeding sites in public spaces and sightings of adult
tiger mosquitoes. You'll find detailed information by clicking the information (i) icons.

<h2>Keep your information updated </h2>
Use the "MY MAP" button to view your reports and edit them if necessary to update or correct information.

<h2>Volunteer for missions</h2>
If you are using the Android version of Tigatrapp, you will be notified of special missions by an icon appearing on your
device's status bar. You can complete the mission at any time, postpone it for later, or delete it from your device.
Check pending missions from the options menu on the main screen.

<h2>Explore other options</h2>
Explore the options menus on each screen to access additional features. Change the base map style, share the app with
friends, or check the latest news from AtrapaelTigre.com.


<h1>YOUR DATA</h1>
The information you submit is sent to the Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC), which is coordinating the
AtrapaelTigre project. The data will be used to learn more about the spread of tiger mosquitoes in Spain and may be
shared with third parties or the public.

Tigatrapp also collects coarse information on your location at random times throughout the day in order to generate a
map of the areas being monitored by Tigatrapp users, and to learn about the routes along which tiger mosquitoes may be
spreading. These locations are masked by rounding your actual location to the nearest 0.05 degrees latitude and
longitude, making it possible to know that you were in an area roughly the size of a small city like Blanes, but
impossible to know where you were in that area. The locations are linked only to your randomly-generated user ID, and no
personally-identifying information is collected.

Parts of the data you share will be automatically published on the web map at AtrapaelTigre.com. At any time you can
delete, edit and update the data on this map from your phone by clicking the "MY MAP" button on the main screen and
selecting a report.
