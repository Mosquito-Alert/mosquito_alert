        <h2>What is Mosquito Alert?</h2>
        <p>Mosquito Alert is a citizen science platform that facilitates collaboration between various actors to study,
            monitor and control mosquito species that carry diseases like dengue, Zika, chikungunya and West Nile
            virus.</p>
        <p>The project gives key roles to citizens, scientists, public health experts and educators. Mosquito Alert lets
            anyone collect and share data (1) and engage in data validation alongside professional entomologists, who
            label mosquito reports and respond to participants (2). Once validated, data is made available to the
            general public through an interactive web map (3). It is also relied on by scientists (4) and by public
            health agents (5) to study and monitor disease vector mosquitoes.</p>

        <h2>Why is Mosquito Alert needed?</h2>
        <p>In recent decades the number of invasive mosquitoes and emerging mosquito-borne diseases has increased on a
            global scale. New invasive species, mainly of the genus Aedes , have settled in new areas and continue to
            expand. Aedes mosquitoes are important from a health perspective because of their ability to transmit
            diseases like dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Likewise, the common mosquito (Culex pipiens) is important
            because it can transmit the West Nile virus. The risk mosquitoes pose to public health makes it important to
            monitor their populations.</p>
        <p>Given the complexity of the problem, Mosquito Alert opens up mosquito surveillance and research to the
            public, allowing collaboration between different actors through its app and its other platforms and
            communities.</p>
        <h2>What data is collected?</h2>
        <p>Data is collected on 5 different mosquito species: the tiger mosquito (<em>Aedes albopictus</em>), the yellow
            fever mosquito (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>), the Asian bush mosquito (<em>Aedes japonicus</em>), the Korean
            mosquito (<em>Aedes koreicus</em>), and the common mosquito (<em>Culex pipiens</em>).</p>

        </p>


        <p>For these species, data is collected on adult mosquitoes and their breeding sites and bites. All of this data
            is important for better understanding these species, and for monitoring and controlling them.</p>

        <p>Mosquito Alert also collects the approximate locations of participants' devices, sampling these locations at
            5 random times each day unless the participant has opted out of this. Locations are masked on a grid of
            0.025 x 0.025 degrees latitude and longitude (approximately 2x2 km) before being sent to the Mosquito Alert
            server. For privacy reasons, only the grid square identifier is actually shared with Mosquito Alert, not the
            precise location. This information is highly valuable from a scientific perspective, as it enables
            researchers to make better estimates about mosquito populations, distinguishing, for example, places with
            few mosquitoes from places with few participants (but potentially many mosquitoes). Participant locations
            provide information about what is known in ecology as the sampling effort.</p>

        <h2>What is the data used for?</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li type="disc">The reports people send to Mosquito Alert have proven in recent years to be an effective
                early warning system against the invasion of new mosquitoes. The system is used to monitor established
                mosquito populations and discover new populations.
            </li>
            <li type="disc">Observations of mosquitoes, breeding sites and bites help scientists and public health
                managers to assess the risk and manage disease vector populations. In order to estimate the abundance of
                mosquitoes in a given site, it is important to adjust observations based on sampling effort. To do this,
                the Mosquito Alert app collects data on the approximate position of the device at random times of the
                day. Positions are masked on a grid of approximately 2x2 km to protect privacy.
            </li>
            <li type="disc">Work is currently underway to develop a real-time, participatory and dynamic epidemiological
                risk prediction system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Where can I find more information?</h2>
        <p>You will find more information on the project website and on social media.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.mosquitoalert.com/en/">www.mosquitoalert.com</a></p>
        <p>In the settings of the app you will find a participant tutorial, a guide to help you identify mosquitos, the
            privacy policy and terms of use, and information about the entities behind this project.</p>
